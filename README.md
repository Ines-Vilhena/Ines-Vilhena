👋 Hi, I’m Ines-Vilhena!

 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning. I love receiving raw data, cleaning it and applying the best tuned models to discover information inside, much like mining to
 discover a diamond.
 
🌱 I’m currently learning R, and have an already solid Python knowledge. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a innovative company with a Data Science team, ready to do meaningful work that helps society in some way.
